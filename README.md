# scrum-notes
--> Agile and Scrum are not the same thing
--> project methodologies -> Scrum (Early evolution) Others: TDD, XP
--> Eliminating waste from projects
--> Agile Manifesto
	--> 4 Principles:
						1. Value individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools
						2. Working software OVER comprehensive documentations
						3. Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
						4. Responding to change OVER following a plan
	-->	Principles aligned in 3 broad categories:
						1. The customer and how teams work with them
						2. Team and how members get selected and how they work with them
						3. The product and process (How agile teams produce best product?)

Scrum Master

--> Framework: Just enough preparation, just in time for development work to begin
--> Maximize the efficiency of developer
--> Incorporate the customer into a team, because a developer need to know exactly what a customer wants
--> Better way of doing things, 
--> shifts our perspective from believing that process itself is valuable, to believing results of the process are more valuable
--> Moving away from defined process management to Empirical processes (What tells you more ?)

--> Scrum Values (Courage, Commitment, focus, openness, and respect) --> Establish Trust
	-> Lightweight
	-> Easy to understand
	-> Scrum is hard to master
	
--> Three pillars supporting empirical processes:
	-> Transparency
	-> Inspection
	-> Adaptation

--> Scrum events are used to drive the empirical processes:
	-> Sprint planning
	-> Daily Scrum
	-> Sprint review 
	-> Sprint restrospective

--> Scrum master: 
	-> is not a project manager.
	-> helps product owner/stakeholder become part of the process.
	-> Ensure backlog is updated
	-> Make sure sprints are appropriate (Doesn't demand too much from the team in any sprint)
	-> Helps development team perform at the highest level possible
		
	-> Protect development teams from outside distractions
	-> Protect against overwork and burnout (no overcommiting)
	-> Protect from complecancy (Getting too comfortable) (Undercommiting)
	-> Owns the scrum framework himself
	-> Servant leader
		-> When you are serving others you are not focussed on being the best or the brightest
		-> When you are a servant your focus is on enabling people and organisations to: 
			-> Understand the process 
			-> Adopt the values and practises related to scrum.
	-> Serves the development team, the PO, and the whole organisation.
	-> Serves the PO:
		-> helping the PO make sure the goals and objectives for development team are clear
		-> Coaching the PO on best practises for product backlog management,
		-> Guiding the PO on empirical process and product planning
		-> Facilitating scrum events as requested or needed
		-> Sharing their knowledge of agility and Scrum
	-> Development team:
		-> Coaching developing team on self-organisation
		-> Helping teams understand the scrum philosophy and values
		-> Guiding development teams on scrum framework
		-> Facilitating the development team in problem solving and removing impediments
	-> Organisation:
		-> Coach the organisation on right ways to adopt scrum
		-> Guiding the organisation and understanding the empirical process
		-> Helping other scrum masters to be more effective and 
		-> Assissting their development teams  to achieve higher performance, the organisation needs. (Hard Work)

--> Product Owner:
	-> Just one person, not a committee or group of people
	-> Business representative
	-> Needs to be experienced enough to answer development teams questions
	-> Need to have sufficient influence in the organisation to negotiate Product Backlog Items (PBI) with their peers and leaders.
	-> They must have strong interpersonal skills across different levels of the organisation
	-> PO is entrusted making all the decisions of the product
	-> This is the individual the development team will turn to when it comes to questions product vision and features that are needed to attain that vision
	-> Responsibilty to represent all stakeholders of the product
	-> Development team only take direction from person dedicated as PO.
	-> Responsible for maximizing the development value
	-> Keeping ordered product backlog, the PO is communicating what is right thing to do and when is the right time.
	-> Responsibilty:
		-> Clearly express PBIs
		-> Orders PBIs efficiently,
		-> Ensure Backlog is accessible.
		-> Clarify	requirements 
		-> Providing status report and forecast
		-> SOmetimes it is necessary to abnormally terminate a sprint. Rare but happen sometimes. (If PBI has no value)

--> Development Team:
	-> Group of people, tasked at creating a potentially shippable product increment at the end of the sprint.
	-> People with all the skills needed to do work that's defined in the PB(Product Backlog).
	-> 3-9 people in development team, excluding PO and Scrum Master
	
--> Shared resources:
	-> When skillset is required for limited period of time.
	-> Shared resources might cause disruption but it needs to be minimized. The best ways are :
		-> including resources early on (early inclusion)
		-> Big picture perspective (Of what the team is building)
		-> Backlog understanding and rough timing estimations of when they will need to be actively involved (Temporary team members).
		
--> Establish Norms:
	-> Forming, Storming, norming and performing -- Helping team reach performance stage faster
	-> Goal is to help all individuals express behaviours that will help them perform at the best of their abilities
	-> Scrum master task is to help scrum team become high performing.
	-> Areas of Norms:
		-> Interaction
			-> Considering ideas
			-> Asking for help
			-> Keeping commitments
			-> Holding team accountable to keep up the norms
		-> Communication
			-> Respect
			-> Gratitude
		-> Meeting Interaction
			-> Device usage
			-> Start/End times
			-> Working hours = preferred hours (9-5)
		-> Decision-Making
			-> Consensus Standards
			-> Voting rules
			-> Tiebrakers
		-> Conflict Resolution
			-> Process
			-> Expectations
			-> Escalation
	-> Don't establish too many norms that team suffers to accomodate. Start with a few and add more as the team needs.

--> Team Spaces
	-> Osmotic Communication (Can help team members to learn from each other)
	-> Co-location is great when we need to collaborate, but it's not so good when it is all technical and you need focus and concentrate.
	-> People need spaces for both collaborative work and spaces to escape for quiet, focussed work.
	-> CAVES AND COMMON
	-> Digital file sharing and collaboration (JIRA, Online Shared spaces), for team overseas and onsite
	-> Slack, facetime, teams, skype etc for chat and video calls.
	
--> Scrum Events:
	-> Scrum Guide: https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html
		
		-> Four Prescribed formal events:
			
			-> Sprint Planning:
				-> Sprint is heart of scrum then sprint planning is "Lifeblood of sprint"
				-> Product vision and backlog are transformed into an actionable plan for delivery of new version or product increment.
				-> Defined goals and objectives
				-> Sprint Planning Meeting Inputs:
					-> Ordered product backlog
					-> Record of completed items in last sprint
					-> Knowledge of past performance
					-> Development team's capacity (OOO) - So we don't overcommit
					-> What will we do? and How will we do it?
					-> PO will provide a no of candidate items to a development team. Dev team decides which items should come into sprint.
					-> Once items are selected Scrum team determines what sprint goal is
					-> Sprint Goal:
						-> Summary of work and value that will be delivered in the product increment.
					-> Tasks: 
						-> Each task should take less than 1 day to complete.
					-> Sprint planning outcomes:
						-> Sprint Goal
						-> Backlog items for sprint (Sprint backlog for scrum)
						-> Plan for completing the work (Sprint backlog for scrum)
			
			-> Daily Scrum:
				-> Coming out of Sprint Planning, Scrum has full understanding of what dev team will do during sprint.
				-> According to Scrum guide:
					-> Scrum Master don't have to attend or interfere, just make sure it happens everyday and doesn't exceed 15 min timebox (effective).
					-> Attended and Facilitated by Dev Team
					-> No PO participation is okay
				-> According to Scrum Alliance: (More commonly used)
					-> Entire Scrum attends
					-> Any scrum team member can provide updates
					-> Any interested party can attend.
				-> Common Questions to team:
					-> What did i do yesterday to help meet the sprint goal?
					-> What will i do today to help meet the sprint goal?
					-> What impediments do i have that are blocking me from meeting the sprint goal?
			
			-> Sprint review:
				-> Inspect and Adapt event for the scrum team and their key stakeholders.
				-> Product increment is the subject of inspection and adaptation
				-> End of sprint (Second last event)
				-> Afternoon of the last day of the sprint.
				-> Maximize time in the morning to finalize product increment that will be shared in sprint review during afternoon.
				-> Informal, Focus is on collaboration, learning from last sprint, and adapting backlog based on learning.
					-> PO gives goal and PBIs give overview
					-> Dev team demonstrates product increment and answers questions
					-> PO shares backlog and new PBIs.
					-> PO encourages open discussion with stakeholders.
					-> PO incorporates feedback into the backlog.
					-> Time boxed (effective)
			
			-> Sprint retrospective:
				-> Retro for short, last event in the sprint.
				-> All other events focussed on product and building the product increment.
				-> This event is focussed on Scrum Team and their practices.
				-> Outcome is a plan that scrum team creates for improvements they intend to make in next sprint
				-> Areas of focus:
					-> How they worked as a team
					-> Health of team relationship
					-> Collaboration
					-> Processes and tools functionality
				-> Questions to ask:
					-> What went well during the sprint?
					-> What didn't go well?
						-> Only choose 1 or 2 items out of this list to work upon in next sprint. Improvement items should never detract from main focus of sprint.
			
			-> Product Backlog refinement:
				-> Ongoing process, PO needs to get more info about needs and requirements for the product (Progressive elaboration)
				-> Actual meeting scrum teams use after midpoint in the sprint.
				-> Items Ready for a sprint:
					-> Proper Size
					-> Dependencies identified (Upstream or downstream)
					-> Story has been sized by development team.
					-> Acceptance criteria have been defined.
					
					-> Scrum guide does not call for a Backlog refinement event, Scrum Alliance does.
					
--> Inspect and Adapt something
--> Sprint shouldn't last more than a month, if we do we are not providing the team the chance to inspect and adapt
